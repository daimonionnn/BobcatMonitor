# BobcatRecycler v 0.1 for Windows
Bobcat helium miner monitoring and reset/resync tool for Windows



Bobcat Recycler monitors blockchain Gap and other parameters.
If Gap goes above specified treshold (default 15), Bobcat will be automatically cycled - Reset + Fast sync  or  Reset + Resync + Fast sync.


It was developed especially for (but not only) defective Bobcat miners - some of them are resetting several times a day and are unable to sync.
The only temporary solution to fix this is RESET + FAST SYNC or RESYNC + FAST SYNC.



This is Windows application (Windows forms, .net framework 4.7.2) but I plan also plan cmd app for Linux and Windows. 



If you like this app and would like to support further development, you can donate some fraction of HNT to my address:
