# Bobcat Monitor and JumpStarter v 0.2 for Windows
Bobcat helium miner monitoring and reset/resync tool for Windows

# Description
Bobcat Monitor monitors blockchain Gap and other parameters.
If Gap goes above specified treshold (default 20), Bobcat will be automatically cycled - Reset + Fast sync  or  Reset + Resync + Fast sync.

It was developed especially for (but not only) defective Bobcat miners - some of them are resetting several times a day and are unable to sync.
The only temporary solution to fix this is RESET + FAST SYNC or RESYNC + FAST SYNC.

# Installation
Download zip file from Binaries directory, extract and run

# Platform
This is Windows only application (Windows forms, .net framework 4.7.2) but I plan cmd app for Linux and Windows. 

# Donation
